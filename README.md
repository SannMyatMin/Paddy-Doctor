## Features of the Platform

### Crop Care AI 🤖

The heart of the system is designed for **maximum convenience**. Farmers no longer need to manually identify pests; they only need a single photo to get a complete solution.

#### How it works:

- **Simple Input:** Select city and upload a photo of the affected paddy leaf.
- **AI Analysis:** System instantly diagnoses the disease, explains the root cause, and provides a detailed treatment plan in Burmese.
- **End-to-End Solution:** It doesn't just stop at a diagnosis—it recommends specific **usable drugs** and automatically finds **nearby agro-shops** in user's city that stock those exact items.

## Tech Stack

### Multi-Output Deep Learning Model 🧠

System utilizes a customized MobileNetV2 architecture, specifically designed for efficient performance on mobile and web platforms. Unlike standard models, Crop Care AI features a unique Multi-Task Learning head that can simultaneously predict three critical factors from a single image:

- **Disease Classification:** Identifies the specific type of paddy disease with high precision using Softmax activation.

- **Variety Recognition:** Detects the rice variety (e.g., ADT 45, Pusa) to provide more contextual farming advice.

- **Crop Age Estimation:** Predicts the growth stage (in days) using a Linear regression output, helping farmers track crop maturity.

- **Training Result**

### Bridging AI with Local Knowledge(Data Strategy) 📚 
Crop Care AI doesn't just provide raw predictions; it delivers actionable insights by integrating AI outputs with a localized knowledge base. This approach ensures the information is practical and reliable for Myanmar farmers.

* **Curated Knowledge Base:** Instead of generic AI responses, the system uses a verified database of paddy diseases, causes, and treatments. This information is meticulously collected from real-life agricultural practices and widely used field methods in Myanmar.

* **Dynamic Shop Mapping:** To make the solution truly convenient, system map the recommended treatments to a curated database of local agro-chemical shops. This bridges the gap between diagnosis and actual cure.

* **Localized Context:** By using these Knowledge-based expert systems, it ensures that every piece of advice is linguistically appropriate and culturally relevant to the local farming community.

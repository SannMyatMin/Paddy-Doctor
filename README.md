## Tech Stack

### Multi-Output Deep Learning Model 🧠

System utilizes a customized MobileNetV2 architecture, specifically designed for efficient performance on mobile and web platforms. Unlike standard models, Crop Care AI features a unique Multi-Task Learning head that can simultaneously predict three critical factors from a single image:

- **Disease Classification:** Identifies the specific type of paddy disease with high precision using Softmax activation.

- **Variety Recognition:** Detects the rice variety (e.g., ADT 45, Pusa) to provide more contextual farming advice.

- **Crop Age Estimation:** Predicts the growth stage (in days) using a Linear regression output, helping farmers track crop maturity.
